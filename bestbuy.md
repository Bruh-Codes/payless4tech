BEST BUY AND ITS RELATED ENTITIES DO NOT SEEK TO EXCLUDE OR RESTRICT ITS LIABILITY FOR PERSONAL INJURY ARISING FROM ITS NEGLIGENCE.

Dispute Resolution by Binding Individual Arbitration
ANY DISPUTE INVOLVING YOU AND BEST BUY OR ANY OF ITS AGENTS MUST BE RESOLVED THROUGH INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION, EXCEPT AS FOLLOWS:

ANY DISPUTE FALLING WITHIN THE JURISDICTIONAL SCOPE AND AMOUNT OF AN APPROPRIATE SMALL CLAIMS COURT MUST BE BROUGHT IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS; AND
ANY DISPUTE TO SEEK TO ENJOIN INFRINGEMENT OR OTHER MISUSE OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS MAY BE BROUGHT IN ANY COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION.
“Dispute” shall be interpreted broadly and cover any claim or controversy arising out of or relating in any way whatsoever to your relationship or interaction with Best Buy, its agents, and its present and future subsidiaries, affiliates, and designees – including, but not limited to, GreatCall, Lively, Geek Squad, Magnolia, and Pacific Sales – whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory. Examples of relationships or interactions giving rise to a covered claim include, without limitation: (1) your use of Best Buy’s websites; (2) your membership in any Best Buy loyalty or rewards program (e.g., My Best Buy®) or subscription-based services (e.g., Total Tech Support); (3) your receipt of delivery, repair or installation services or consultation services provided by Best Buy or its agents; (4) any communications between you and Best Buy; (5) application for financing; and/or (6) your purchase of products or services offered, sold, or distributed by Best Buy including, but not limited to, any Dispute arising from the advertising of, or the sales practices related to, such products and services. If you are a My Best Buy® member, Dispute shall also include all disputes that arose before your enrollment in, and after the cancellation or termination of, the My Best Buy® program, including any claims that are the subject of a purported class action litigation.

BY AGREEING TO ARBITRATION, YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOU ARE WAIVING YOUR RIGHT TO MAINTAIN OTHER AVAILABLE RESOLUTION PROCESSES, SUCH AS A COURT ACTION OR ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDING, TO SETTLE DISPUTES. THE RULES IN ARBITRATION ARE DIFFERENT. THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY, LESS DISCOVERY, AND LIMITED APPELLATE REVIEW. ARBITRATORS CAN AWARD THE SAME DAMAGES AND RELIEF THAT A COURT CAN AWARD.

Either Party may initiate an arbitration proceeding by sending a demand to the American Arbitration Association (AAA) that describes the basis for the claim. You may serve a copy of a demand on our registered agent CT Corporation System, Inc., 100 South Fifth Street, Suite 1075, Minneapolis, MN 55402. The arbitration will be governed by the AAA’s Consumer Arbitration Rules or Commercial Arbitration Rules (collectively, the “AAA Rules”), as appropriate, and as modified by these Terms, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules and the form for filing an arbitration claim are available at www.adr.org. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA’s Rules; however, we will reimburse those fees (but not any attorney’s fees) for claims totaling less than $10,000 except where (1) the claims fall within the jurisdictional scope and amount of an appropriate small claims court and, despite the requirement in this provision that such claims be brought in small claims court, you instead filed with AAA; or (2) the arbitrator determines your claims are frivolous. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in your demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all such fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In such case, you agree to reimburse Best Buy for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the county where you live or at another mutually agreed upon location.

YOU AND BEST BUY AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, CONSOLIDATED, OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. THIS MEANS THAT YOU MAY NOT PURPORT TO ACT ON BEHALF OF A CLASS OR ANY OTHER PERSON. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim. The arbitrator may not award relief for or against anyone who is not a party to the arbitration proceeding. Further, unless both you and Best Buy agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. If a court determines that public injunctive relief may not be waived and all appeals from that decision have been exhausted, then the parties agree that any claim for public injunctive relief shall be stayed pending arbitration of the remaining claims. If this specific paragraph is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this dispute resolution provision (except for the jury trial waiver) shall be null and void.

If for any reason a claim may proceed in court rather than in arbitration, WE EACH WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL, UNLESS SUCH WAIVER IS UNENFORCEABLE. THIS MEANS THAT ANY CLAIM WOULD BE DECIDED BY A JUDGE, NOT A JURY.

This dispute resolution provision shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act. It shall survive any termination or cancellation of, or your participation in, any membership programs or subscription services. Any amendments to this dispute resolution provision shall not affect any then active or pending arbitration proceeding.

Independent Developments
We may independently create applications, content and other products or services that may be similar to or competitive with your Application and its content, and nothing in this Agreement will restrict or prevent us from creating and fully exploiting such applications, content and other items, without any obligation to you. If you elect to provide us with any feedback, you assign all right, title and interest in and to such feedback to us, and we may use, implement and exploit any such feedback in any manner without restriction, and without any obligation of confidentiality, attribution or compensation or other duty to account.

General Terms
Any breach of the Terms by you may result in irreparable harm to us for which damages would be an inadequate remedy and, therefore, we will be entitled to equitable relief, including injunctive relief, if such a breach occurs. You waive any requirement for the posting of a bond or other security if we seek such an injunction.

The Terms, together with the Governing Agreements, constitute the entire agreement between you and Best Buy relating to the Service, and supersede any prior versions of the Terms. No modification to the Terms will be binding, unless in writing and signed by an authorized Best Buy representative. You may not assign, sublicense, delegate or otherwise transfer the Terms or any right granted hereunder.
